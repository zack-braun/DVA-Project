This notebook attempts to explain the major functionality needed for our group project, but for more information you can check __[ProPublica's API documentation](https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/)__. Note that you'll need to get an API Key in order to access the information; users with an API key are restricted to 5000 requests per day. You can sign up at ProPublica's __[ProPublica's Data Store](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/api/propublica-congress-api)__.\n",

    "- Roll-call vote data (1991 onward for House; 1989 onward for Senate)\n",

    "- Bill data (since 1995)\n",
    "- Floor actions\n",

    "To start acquiring data on Congressional members it is first useful to retrieve a list of all the members. This is accomplished by adding the Congressional session and chamber to the base API URL and requesting that members.json be returned. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The format is: Base URL + {congress}/{chamber}/members.json**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the base URL with <font color=green>115/senate/members.json</font> would request the list of senators in the 115th Congress, while <font color=green>115/house/members.json</font> would request members of the House of Representatives from the 115th Congress. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code below illustrates how one could return this information easily via Python. However, in practice it would be necessary to loop through multiple Congressional sessions and also retrieve data for the House and Senate. Since legislator's can serve in multiple sessions and have different roles in those sessions, we'll need to look for potential duplicates in the returned data we plan to use for our project. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is also an API endpoint to get additional informatino for a specific member. This includes additional information on the member's roles on committees. But it seems like this might be more easily pulled via the committee API. Other than the committee information, it doesn't seem like we'll need to worry about the individual member query too much."

However, that would require a list of all the bills in a given congress (i.e.: the list of all Senate and House bills in the 114 Congress).
